// Your pre-task challenge! 

// Application logic: 
// Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. 
// For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 
// For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 
// For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

// Remember, you need to figure out what the requirements are, write the test FIRST, before starting on app logic! 
// To save time, I would use table tests :)
